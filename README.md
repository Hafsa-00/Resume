<h1> Resume </h1>
<p>This project is a resume webpage that includes sections for Personal Information, Education, Skills, and Work Experience. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsive design, and TypeScript for basic interactivity.</p>
<h2> Sections </h2>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<ul>
  <LI>Name</LI>
  <li>Contact Details</li>
  <li>Profile Picture</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Skills</li>
  <li>Interactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>
TypeScript is used to add basic interactivity, such as a button to toggle the visibility of the “Skills” section or other sections.</p>
